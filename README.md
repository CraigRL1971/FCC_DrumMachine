# FCC Drum Machine

This is my solution for the [FCC Drum Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine) challenge.  I wrote this app using React.js and the react-bootstrap package.  The drum machine window itself was implemented as a modal, which in retrospect I would not repeat for a project like this.
